## HTML & CSS Homework Week2 Homework6
# Requirement: Design your portfolio by following any one of the below mentioned styles.

# Portfolio

For today's homework, you will practice HTML & CSS  by creating your own portfolio website!


Here's the sections you'll have to include into your page. You can design them however you want.


## Navigation Bar

This will usually include your name/logo and buttons that link to the different sections of your page.

---
## 'About Me'

Anything could go here! Who are you? What's your story? What do you like/dislike? How did your journey get you here? Which Hogwarts house are you?

---
## 'Skills'

Hey, guess what goes under here? CSS and JavaScript are a start! You can add anything else! Are you a good cook? Do you know how to whistle the entire alphabet? Is your LOTR lore knowledge unmatchable?

---
## 'Experiences' or 'Projects'

Projects?? Yes! You going to have Project1 under your belt now. You are a developer, and no one can question it!

---
## Footer

Keep it simple! Your contact information, social icons, and your copyright notice are enough.
